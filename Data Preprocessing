Before conducting any analysis or building visualizations, the dataset underwent a detailed preprocessing phase to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and readiness for effective analysis. Preprocessing is a critical step that enhances the quality of insights and ensures that visual outputs reflect reliable and interpretable information.
Steps Taken for Preprocessing:
1.	Data Cleaning:
	Removed rows with completely blank or irrelevant entries.
	Standardized textual data for uniformity (e.g., consistent naming for states, indicators, and categories).
	Filtered out data fields not relevant to the project scope to streamline analysis.
2.	Handling Missing Values:
	Excluded rows where essential values such as data value, year, or state were missing to maintain integrity.
	Verified the completeness of key demographic fields like gender, age group, and race/ethnicity.
3.	Data Type Conversion:
	Converted numeric fields such as "Data Value" and "Sample Size" to appropriate number formats (float/int).
	Ensured all categorical attributes (State, Indicator, Year, etc.) were stored as text for filtering and grouping.
4.	Derived Column Creation:
	Created calculated fields where applicable, such as "Normalized Rate" or "Trend Indicator" to support visual comparisons over time.
	Grouped indicators under broader health categories (e.g., Cardiovascular, Metabolic, Behavioral) to enhance dashboard usability.
5.	Data Formatting for Excel:
	Final cleaned dataset was saved in .xlsx format for compatibility with Excel features.
	Created pivot tables and charts across different sheets to support state-wise, gender-wise, and disease-wise analysis.
	Applied interactive slicers for State, Disease Category, Year, Gender, and Age Group to enable customized exploration within the dashboard.
This preprocessing phase ensured the dataset was structured, clean, and optimized for insightful analysis through the Excel-based interactive dashboard. It laid the groundwork for accurate visual representation and evidence-based interpretations of chronic disease patterns in the U.S.
